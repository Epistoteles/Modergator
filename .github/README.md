# üêä Modergator - Hate Speech Detection
Modergator is a Telegram bot who is able to process several kinds of messages send in a Telegram group. The messages are checked for hate speech and an evaluation of the offensiveness and hatefulness are given. There exists an option to optout of the processing of messages for the users of the group.

WARNING: The repository contains content that is offensive and/or hateful in nature.

## üéØ Key Features

This bot checks incoming messages for hate speech and offensive language based on the HateXplain dataset and model (https://github.com/hate-alert/HateXplain). Memes are analyzed with vilio (https://github.com/Muennighoff/vilio), which has been trained on the Facebook dataset for multimodal natural language processing (https://ai.facebook.com/tools/hatefulmemes/).

## üí° How To Use

In order to use the bot, a Telegram account is needed. For instructions on how to create an account, see: https://telegram.org/. To find the bot, you search for @modergator_bot in the search bar in the telegram application. You can then either interact directly with the bot or add the bot to a group by typing a message in the text field. Every message you or members of the group send are analyzed anonymously for potential hate speech or offensive language. If this case occurs, you will get a message from the bot. In case you disagree with the classification, you can type /poll and you and the other group members can vote and discuss their classification.

You don't want the bot to process your messages? Just type /optout and your messages will be ignored. You changed your mind? With /optin you can give access to the processing again.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

As torch 1.4.0 does not work with python versions later than 3.8, you need python 3.8.

First, you need to install the following dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get -y install screen net-tools tesseract-ocr virtualenv
```
This is the only step for which you need sudo rights.

Next, run the provided install script:
```
source install.sh
```
This does the following:
- create several virtual environments
- create user-specific configs
- download models that are too big for GitHub
- install all Python dependencies


### Using the Telegram Bot

And then start the bot with
```
source run.sh
```
This will start a virtual environment, install all dependencies inside it and start each program inside a screen session.


### Meme API

### Voice API

### Target API
#### How the target detection works

the target detection is based on HateXplain (for more information see https://github.com/hate-alert/HateXplain). The dataset contains annotated tweets which have been labeled as hate speech, offensive or normal language. The detection is trained on the dataset and returns a list of discriminated target groups.

The telegram bot executes the target detection for all kinds of messages.

###Folder description
model.py --> the trained model
main.py --> the target api that communicates with the bot and the model

### Usage instructions
The trained model can be used to predict new input.

-> the pth must be download [TODO: link] and placed into target-api/model

## Dump: Below here old README concent to be deleted

Go into meme-model-api/vilio/py-bottom-up-attention/ and run in a virtual evironment (source meme-model-api/memeenv/bin/activate) ```python3 setup.py build develop```. This will create a configs directory with files in vilio/py-bottom-up-attention/detectron2/model_zoo that is not pushed to git
(because its user-specific) <---- now in install.py

* to use the target API, add the model "hate_target.pth" from here https://www.kaggle.com/katinka21/modergator-target-detection-model into the folder:  target-api/model/hate_target.pth.
* to use the meme API, add the model "LASTtrain.pth" from here https://www.kaggle.com/muennighoff/viliou36?select=LASTtrain.pth into the folder:  model-meme-api/vilio/input/viliou36/LASTtrain.pth"  <---- not necessary any more, now uploaded to git with git-lfs
